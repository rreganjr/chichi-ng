## Fancy pants UI components for Angular

[chichi - frilly or elaborate ornamentation](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/chichi)  

## bypass panel

Like a closet with bypass doors where a panel (door) can be slid back and forth to show content behind. The panels also have content and buttons for sliding them.

I didn't concieve of this design, I watched a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUdo6w87rh4) by Traversy Media that put this together based on the article [DOUBLE SLIDER - SIGN IN/UP FORM](https://www.florin-pop.com/blog/2019/03/double-slider-sign-in-up-form/) by Florin Pop who was inspired by [Diprella Login](https://dribbble.com/shots/5311359-Diprella-Login) by Selecto on dribbble. I took the basic concept and created an Angular component that generalized the sliding panel.
